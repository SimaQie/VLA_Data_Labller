    "prompt": "You are a trainer explaining a robot's operation to a new technician. Watch the video and generate a step-by-step guide.\nFor each key step in the operation, identify the exact moment in the video where that step begins. Focus on moments where the robot's primary action changes.\n\nObjects that may appear in the video include: {objects_text}\n\nPlease output the analysis results in JSON format with the following structure:\n\n{{\n    \"phases\": [\n        {{\n            \"phase_number\": 1,\n            \"phase_name\": \"phase name\",\n            \"start_time\": \"0:00\",\n            \"end_time\": \"0:15\",\n            \"description\": \"Detailed description of the operation content, robot actions and objects used in this phase\"\n        }},\n        {{\n            \"phase_number\": 2,\n            \"phase_name\": \"phase name\", \n            \"start_time\": \"0:15\",\n            \"end_time\": \"0:45\",\n            \"description\": \"Detailed description...\"\n        }}\n    ],\n    \"summary\": \"Brief overall summary of the operation\"\n}}\n\nRequirements:\n1. Time format must use \"minutes:seconds\", e.g., \"0:15-0:45\"\n2. Phase names should be concise and clear\nn3. Descriptions should be specific, including objects used and specific actions\n4. Ensure temporal continuity without overlaps\n5. Output ONLY valid JSON, no additional text"
