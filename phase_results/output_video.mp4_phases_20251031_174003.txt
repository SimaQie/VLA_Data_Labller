Phase 3: 0:11-0:17 | Plate Placement and Completion

【Phase Description】
Phase 1 Initial Setup: The video begins with a static shot of a black wire dish rack on a white table. Inside the rack, there are five stacked plates in various colors (pink, teal, yellow, light blue, and gray), arranged vertically. The environment is clean and well-lit, indicating the setup is ready for the robotic operation.

Phase 2 Plate Removal: A robotic arm enters the frame from the right side, equipped with a gripper end effector. The robotic arm moves toward the top plate (pink) and carefully grips it. It then lifts the plate upward, rotating it slightly to dislodge it from the stack. The robotic arm continues to lift the plate, revealing the yellow plate underneath. The robotic arm then fully removes the top plate (pink) from the stack and moves it away from the rack.

Phase 3 Plate Placement and Completion: After removing the top plate, the robotic arm places the plate on the white table, directly in front of the dish rack. The plate is set down gently, ensuring it is stable and not tilted. The robotic arm then retracts, leaving the plate resting on the table while the remaining plates remain in the dish rack. The scene ends with the robotic arm fully retracted, and the setup showing the removed plate on the table and the remaining plates in the rack.
