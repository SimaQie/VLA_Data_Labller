【Phase Division】
Phase 1: 0:00-0:03 | Initial Setup
Phase 2: 0:04-0:09 | Robot Gripper Approaches and Grasps Plate
Phase 3: 0:10-0:13 | Robot Removes Plate from Rack
Phase 4: 0:14-0:17 | Robot Releases Plate on Table

【Phase Description】
Phase 1 Initial Setup: The video begins with a static shot of a black metal dish rack on a white table. Inside the rack, five colorful plates are stacked vertically, with the top plate being pink, followed by light blue, yellow, green, and the bottom plate being light gray. The environment is clean and well-lit, indicating a controlled setup for the robotic operation.

Phase 2 Robot Gripper Approaches and Grasps Plate: At 0:04, a robotic arm enters the frame from the right side, equipped with a gripper end effector. The gripper moves toward the top plate (pink) and carefully grasps it. The gripper adjusts its grip to securely hold the plate without causing damage. The robotic arm then lifts the plate slightly, revealing the plate beneath it (light blue).

Phase 3 Robot Removes Plate from Rack: At 0:10, the robotic arm lifts the top plate (pink) completely out of the rack and moves it downward. The plate is then placed on the white table surface, directly in front of the rack, with the gripper still holding it. The robotic arm adjusts its position to ensure the plate is stable on the table.

Phase 4 Robot Releases Plate on Table: At 0:14, the robotic arm releases the plate onto the table, allowing it to rest freely. The gripper then retracts, and the robotic arm moves out of the frame, leaving the plate on the table. The remaining plates in the rack are now visible, with the light blue plate now at the top. The scene ends with the robotic arm out of view and the plate resting on the table.
